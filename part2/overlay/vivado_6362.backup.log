WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /video/hdmi_in/frontend/dvi2rgb_0/RefClk have been updated from connected ip, but BD cell '/video/hdmi_in/frontend/dvi2rgb_0' does not accept parameter changes, so they may not be synchronized with cell properties:
	FREQ_HZ = 200000000 
Please resolve any mismatches by directly setting properties on BD cell </video/hdmi_in/frontend/dvi2rgb_0> to completely resolve these warnings.
